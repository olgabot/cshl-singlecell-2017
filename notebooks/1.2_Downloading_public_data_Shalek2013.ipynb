To be completely honest, R's plotting and graphics capabilities are much better than Python's. However, Python is a really nice langauge to learn and use, it's very memory efficient, can be parallized well, and has a very robust machine learning library, `scikit-learn`, which has a very nice and consistent interface. So this is Python's answer to `ggplot2` (very popular R library for plotting) to try and make plotting in Python nicer looking and to make statistical plots easier to do.\n"
